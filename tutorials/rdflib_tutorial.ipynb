    "\n",
    "RDFlib is a python library for managing RDF data in Python in local servers or server-side web applications. It allows one to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * parse RDF data stored in files (either local or online) with several syntaxes\n",
    " * manipulate RDF data by creating a in-memory graph\n",
    " * query RDF data by means of SPARQL queries and other built-in constructs\n",
    " * serialize and store RDF data in files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does it work? \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a graph is treated as an unordered list of tuples. Each tuple has three elements, namely two/three URIs corresponding to subject, predicate, and object. "
