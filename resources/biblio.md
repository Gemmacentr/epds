## Python libraries for data visualisation

 * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) the most used Python library for data viz. Originally designed to resemble MATLAB (a proprietary language), it is now the basic block of many other libraries for data analysis and plotting. It works well with *pandas* and *seaborn*. The look and feel of visualizations is a bit retrò and it's not the best for publication purposes.
 * [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) built on top of matplotlib, it is a Python visualization library for **statistical plotting**. It comes equipped with preset styles and color palettes so you can create complex, aesthetically pleasing charts with a few lines of code. It's designed to work with NumPy and pandas. Charts can be exported as images. See a few [tutorials](https://mode.com/python-tutorial/libraries/seaborn/)
 * [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) a python library to create interactive, **web-ready plots**, which can be easily output as JSON objects, HTML documents, or interactive web applications. That is, you can use it in Jupyter and export resulting (interactive) plots in HTML pages! Bokeh also supports streaming and real-time data.
 * [pygal](http://www.pygal.org/en/latest/index.html) Like Bokeh and Plotly, pygal offers **interactive plots that can be embedded in the web browser**. Its prime differentiator is the ability to output charts as SVGs. As long as you're working with smaller datasets, SVGs will do you just fine. Each chart type is packaged into a method and the built-in styles are pretty, hence it's easy to create a nice-looking chart in a few lines of code.
 * [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) Like Bokeh, Plotly's allows you to make **interactive plots**, and it offers some charts you won't find in most libraries, like contour plots, dendograms, and 3D charts.
 * [geoplotlib](https://github.com/andrea-cuttone/geoplotlib) a toolbox for creating maps and plotting **geographical data**, a feature that is not available in most of python libraries for data viz.
 * [Gleam](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gleam) It allows you to turn analyses into interactive web apps using only Python scripts, so you don't have to know any other languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Gleam works with any Python data visualization library. Once you've created a plot, you can build fields on top of it so **users can filter and sort data**.
